# Assignment: Add Two Numbers

In this assignment, you will implement a C function to add two numbers.

## Instructions

1. Implement the `add_numbers` function in `add_numbers.c`. This function should take two integers as input and return their sum as an integer.
2. Test your implementation by running `main.c`. It will call your `add_numbers` function and print the result.
3. Once you have successfully implemented the function, push your changes to the GitHub repository.

Good luck!
